# Spa online

# Software design pattern
We are going with the client-server pattern.


The client folder would contain the frontend source code and the server directory would have the server-side code.


## Folder structure

├── client

├── server

├── README.md

└── LICENSE

2 directories, 2 file


The client/frontend would be developed using **Reactjs** and **Nodejs** for the server-side code.

## 📚 Tech stack
Going for `MERN` stack.

|Reactjs        |Nodejs   |MongoDB |
|TailwindCSS    |Mongoose |        |
